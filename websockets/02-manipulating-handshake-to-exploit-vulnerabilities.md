# Lab: Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities

Open the Live Chat and send a message while intercept is turned on. Send the message to the repeater and replace it with `{"message":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"}` before sending it. This results in a block and terminates the connection. Attempting to reconnect results in an error indicating that the address has been blacklisted.

Add `X-Forwarded-For: 1.1.1.1` to the headers of the handshake request to spoof the IP. Connect again and use the XSS payload ```<img src=1 oNeRrOr=alert`1`>``` to bypass the filter.
